# GCVisits

Create a “proof-of-concept” iOS mobile application to demonstrate the following functionality:

1. Extract a list of visit objects from an API and store them in a SQLite database. Note: Only the top level of the visits object needs to be store, all subsequent levels can be ignored for the purpose of the exercise.

2. Render the data store in the database into a “useful” screen which a user would find informative. Note: this can be a basic list and does not require each field returned to be displayed.
